# Deep Q learning on Swing Copters
This project presents an effective way to play the notorious swing copters game using a convolutional neural network 
to estimate the Q-function, using visual input of the game. It uses techniques described in [1] and improves
upon it to play this specific game. 

# Dependencies
* Python 2.7
* Pygame
* Tensorflow
* OpenCV-Python

# Running
```
git clone https://github.com/nishanthpp93/swing-dqn.git
cd swing-dqn
python deep_q_n.py
```
